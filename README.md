3.  **Add your project details** as a new object in the array. That's it!
    

```   // src/App.jsx  
const PROJECTS = [    // ... existing projects    {      title: 'Your Awesome Project',      url: '[https://github.com/your-username/your-repo](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo)',      blurb: 'A short, catchy description of what your project does.'    },    // ... more of your projects  ];
```

The maze will automatically create a portal for your new project.
